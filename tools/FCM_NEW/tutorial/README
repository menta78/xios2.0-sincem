This directory contains the files necessary to set up a Subversion repository
for the FCM tutorial.

For example (in bash/ksh):

(shell)$ cd fcm-release/tutorial/ # to this directory
(shell)$ ./fcm-tutorial-repos-create /path/to/tutorial/repos

The repository should be configured to allow users write access. You may find
it easiest to simply allow anonymous access.

A Trac environment should be configured to be associated with the tutorial
repository. You then need to allow users write access. You may find it easiest
to set up a number of guest accounts for this purpose.
